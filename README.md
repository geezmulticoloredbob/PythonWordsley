Perfect, thanks — that’s exactly the context I needed. Here’s a solid draft README for your repo:

---

# PythonWordsley 🎮

A simple **Wordle-style word guessing game** built from scratch in Python.
Play directly in your terminal and test your word-guessing skills!

---

## Features ✨

* Command-line interface for lightweight, distraction-free gameplay
* Randomly chosen word from the included `word-bank`
* Guess feedback similar to Wordle (correct letters, misplaced letters, etc.)
* Includes test scripts to validate word selection and gameplay logic

---

## Installation ⚙️

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/geezmulticoloredbob/PythonWordsley.git
cd PythonWordsley
```

No external dependencies are required — it runs on pure Python.
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

---

## How to Play 🕹️

Run the game from your terminal:

```bash
python wordsley_game.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the hidden word.
You’ll have a limited number of attempts — good luck!

## Running Tests ✅

Basic gameplay and word selection tests are included in `guess_my_word.py`.

Run them with:

```bash
python guess_my_word.py
```

Do you want me to also include **screenshots / GIF examples** of gameplay in the README (so it looks more engaging on GitHub), or keep it purely text-based?
